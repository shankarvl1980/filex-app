  <h1>Privacy Policy – FileX Manager</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-02-08</p>

  <p>
    FileX Manager (“the app”) is a file management application. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app
    handles and how it is used.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> the app does not collect, store, or sell personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>No ads / no analytics:</strong> the app does not include advertising SDKs or analytics trackers.</li>
    <li><strong>User-initiated access only:</strong> file access, USB access, and network connections happen only when you choose to use those features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>We do not collect personal information.</strong> The app does not require you to create an account and does not
    send personal data to the developer.
  </p>

  <h2>Local Data on Your Device</h2>
  <p>
    FileX Manager works with files and folders you choose to access. To provide file management features, the app may
    read file/folder metadata (such as names, sizes, types, and modified dates) and may store app preferences locally
    on your device (for example, UI settings and user-selected options).
  </p>
  <p>
    This local data stays on your device and is used only to provide the app’s functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Network Features (User-Configured)</h2>
  <p>
    The app includes optional features that connect to services you configure, such as FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, SMB servers,
    and supported cloud providers. These connections are initiated by you when you add an account, connect, browse, upload,
    or download.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any credentials or tokens required for these connections are used only to authenticate your access and perform the actions
    you request. The developer does not receive or store your cloud files.
  </p>

  <h2>USB Mass Storage</h2>
  <p>
    The app supports access to connected USB mass storage devices (for example, FAT32 devices) when you connect the device
    and grant permission through Android. USB access is initiated by you.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    The app does not share your personal information with third parties because it does not collect it.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you use network or cloud features, data is exchanged between your device and the server/provider you selected.
    Those services may have their own privacy policies and terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    The app is designed to keep your data on your device and interact only with the services you configure. However, the security
    of network connections also depends on the server/provider you use and your network environment. If you connect to services that
    do not use encryption (for example, certain <code>http://</code> or plain FTP endpoints), data may be transmitted without encryption.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The app is intended for a general audience and is not designed to collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    If this Privacy Policy changes, the updated version will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer via the support contact shown on the app’s
    Google Play listing.
