  <h1>Terms of Service – FileX Manager</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-02-08</p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the FileX Manager application (“the app”). By using the app,
    you agree to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>
    FileX Manager is a file management tool that allows you to browse and manage files on your device and optionally connect
    to services you configure (such as FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, SMB servers, and supported cloud providers).
  </p>
  <p>
    You are responsible for how you use the app, including the content you access, manage, upload, download, or share.
  </p>

  <h2>2. User-Initiated Connections</h2>
  <p>
    Any network connections and accounts are configured and initiated by you. The app interacts with the servers or providers you choose.
    You are responsible for your accounts, permissions, credentials, and for complying with the terms and policies of those services.
  </p>

  <h2>3. No Warranty</h2>
  <p>
    The app is provided <strong>“as is”</strong> and <strong>“as available”</strong>, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied,
    including (but not limited to) warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
    punitive damages, or any loss of data, loss of profits, or loss of business, arising from or related to your use of the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    File operations (such as delete, move, overwrite, rename, upload, and download) can result in permanent changes. You are responsible for
    ensuring you have backups and for confirming actions before executing them.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>
    You agree not to use the app for unlawful activities or to violate the rights of others. You must comply with applicable laws and regulations.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Updates and Changes</h2>
  <p>
    The developer may update the app and may modify these Terms from time to time. Updated Terms will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
    Your continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    You may stop using the app at any time by uninstalling it. The developer may suspend or discontinue the app at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For support or questions about these Terms, use the support contact shown on the app’s Google Play listing.
